<h3>General information</h3>

</a>
<p>
    This knowledge-base was developed by Paul J Palmer to work with the the Tom.bioVis Framework for ID Visualisations and started in January 2017.<br />
    The selection of moths to include in this version was determined by analysing Leicestershire records between 2013 and 
    2015 and selecting species recorded between Januarary and April. The intial driver for this work was to provided a structured guide to complement
    for a series of moth identification workshops held at the Rutland Water Volunteer Training Centre (VTC), UK
</p>
<p>
    Detailed information used to fill the knowledge base has come from multiple sources including field guides, reference books, 
    websites, specimens (held in my reference collection) and personal photographs. This list is really a place holder to include a better 
    set of references.

<p>
    See the readme file for instructions on how best use this knowledge base in conjuction with the Tom.bioVis Framework.
    Following the suggested arrangement will allow you to cleanly keep this, and other knowledge bases up to date independently 
    of changes to framework.
