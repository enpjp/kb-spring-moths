<!--This is a modified html file to produce knowledge base for the Tombio visulation framework that
sits in a separate directory hierachy to the actual framework itsself.
This mean that the knowledgebase and the test html file can be in a separate git repository
for ease of sharing. As new improvements to the framework are posted to git, they will not overwrite
these files
