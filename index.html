sits in a separate directory hierachy to the actual framework itsself.
This mean that the knowledgebase and the test html file can be in a separate git repository
for ease of sharing. As new improvements to the framework are posted to git, they will not overwrite
these files.

    <h1>Spring Moth Knowledge Base</h1>
<p>This knowledge base as been set up to exploit the benefits of using a computer based parallel key. As such, the grouping of characters follows a convention of considering those that are easy to observe, rather than any sort of taxonomic grouping. The major groupings of first, second .... are best applied in that order. As the characters are entered, each taxon is ranked in order of match guiding the process of identification to taxon level. Other references will always be required for confirmation.
</p>
<p>When using the key, note that identification most improved by selecting features in a range of characters, rather than multiple options of the same character.
