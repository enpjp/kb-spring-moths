A knowledge base to work with the Open Source Tombio Framework. See the Git repositiory a:
https://github.com/burkmarr/tombiovis.git
To work with the Tombio framework add this knowledge base to a directory "knowledge-base_files" which is at the same level as the git controlled "tombiovis-master" directory.
Following this arrangement will enable separate revsion management of knowledge base files and the base framework.
The index.html file has been modified to follow this convention.
