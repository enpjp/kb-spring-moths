# kb-spring-moths
A knowledge base designed to help the identification of spring moths in Leicestershire UK.
This knowledge base has been designed to work with the Open Source Tombio Framework. See the Git repositiory at:
https://github.com/burkmarr/tombiovis.git
To work with the Tombio framework add this knowledge base to a directory "knowledge-base_files" which is at the same level as the git controlled "tombiovis-master" directory.
Following this arrangement will enable separate revsion management of knowledge base files and the base framework.
The index.html file has been modified to follow this convention.
As the key knowledge is captured entirely in csv files, it is possible that this data could be used elsewhere. Please note the application of the GPL licence, which basically says you can do pretty much anything you like with this software / data / images BUT you must include a copy of the license with any deriviatives.

Enjoy
