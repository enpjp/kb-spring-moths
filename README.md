# kb-spring-moths
A knowledge base designed to help the identification of spring moths in Leicestershire UK.
This knowledge base has been designed to work with the Open Source Tombio Framework. See the Git repositiory at:
https://github.com/burkmarr/tombiovis.git
To work with the Tombio framework add this knowledge base to a directory "knowledge-base_files" which is at the same level as the git controlled "tombiovis-master" directory.
Following this arrangement will enable separate revsion management of knowledge base files and the base framework.
The index.html file has been modified to follow this convention.

As this project developed it became clear that some sort of standard descriptive taxonomy was required that was not too cumbersome for general use. There are few words in everyday usage that are useful for describing moth characters so I have had to resort to using words loosely derived from Latin. While researching terminology used in more academic works it became clear while all authors agree on the basal (wing base), medial (middle) and the Termen (End) of the wing, the intermediate areas are less consistent. Thus area between the basal and median part of the wings might be called  subbasal (after the base) or antemedian (before the middle) area. I have arbitrarily reduced the number of named areas in the wing to simplify the knowledge capture, but could not see a way to proceed using everyday language. I hope this is not offputting. 

As the key knowledge is captured entirely in csv files, it is possible that this data could be used elsewhere. Please note the application of the GPL licence, which basically says you can do pretty much anything you like with this software / data / images BUT you must include a copy of the license with any deriviatives.

If you want to chip in and improve this key then you are welcome. Please clone the repository and make a pull request when you are ready. Please make sure any images may be freely used.

Enjoy
