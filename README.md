A knowledge base to work with the Tombio Framework
To work with the Tombio framework add this knowledge base to a directory "knowledge-base_files" which is at the same level as the 
git controlled "tombiovis-master".
Following this arrangement will enable separate revsion management of knowledge base files and the base framework.
Index.html has been modified to follwo this convention.
